Transfer Learning on MNIST using ImageNet Pretrained ResNet (PyTorch)
Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of transfer learning by applying an ImageNet-pretrained
ResNet-18 model to the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. The objective is to achieve high accuracy
with minimal training effort.
Dataset
MNIST contains 60,000 training and 10,000 testing grayscale images of digits from 0 to 9. Images
were resized to 224×224 and converted to 3-channel RGB format to match ImageNet requirements.
Methodology
A ResNet-18 model pretrained on ImageNet was used. The final fully connected layer was replaced
with a 10-class classifier. All pretrained layers were frozen, and only the last layer was trained.
Training Configuration
Loss Function: CrossEntropyLoss
Optimizer: Adam
Learning Rate: 0.001
Batch Size: 64
Epochs: 3
Results
The model achieved a test accuracy of 96.37% (0.9637), demonstrating the effectiveness of
transfer learning.
Conclusion
Transfer learning significantly reduced training time while achieving high accuracy. This project
highlights how pretrained models can be effectively reused for smaller datasets.
